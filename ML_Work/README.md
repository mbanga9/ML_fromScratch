# ML2017_GroupWork

We can commit our work about the labs here so that each member can
have a look at what the others are doing. This repo becomes interesting
if we frequently updates it :)

Useful git commands:

- git clone https://github.com/mbanga9/ML2017_GroupWork.git
- git pull

- git add <local updated file>
  git commit -m "commit message"
  git push
